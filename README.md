## About the App

It's an app to use in warehouses. It displays lists of products per category. For now only 3 categories: jackets, shirts and accessories.

## About the realization

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Deployed into [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages)

## TODO

I made this solution in a way to do as little work as possible when the server refactored.
I suggest creating a "middleware"-server to process data from the current one and fix all the issues and add new functionality. With GraphQL it may be achievable and relatively simple.
